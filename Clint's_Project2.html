    			How the Web Works
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>The Web is a giant network of devices (<em>ex: laptops, PC's, servers, etc.</em>) that can talk to each other via an Internet connection from the device to an ISP. To connect from one device to another the Web uses HTTP (<em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em>) protocol to make this connection.</p>

				<h4><u>EXAMPLE:</u></h4>
				<p>When you type <a href="http://www.udacity.com">www.udacity.com</a> your computer sends HTTP protocol via the Internet connection to the Udacity web server. The Udacity web server then communicates back to your computer using HTTP to send the Udacity homepage.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>is the coding language that is the base of any website.</p>

				<p>HTML is what shows the visual properties of a website. Whether it's plain text, images, or video, HTML is used to code these properties into the website. For a more detailed description view the following link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Wikipedia-HTML</a></p>

    			Inline or Block....What's the Difference?
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>HTML elements are considered either Inline or Block elements. Inline elements usually only displayed without line breaks, such as Underline or Bold elements. Block elements normally contain multiple lines of information. Everything within a block elements is contained in an invisible block. An example of a block element is <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>. This element is used in CSS styling, and when used everything within this tag would use the associated CSS associated styling for that <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> element.</p>

				<p>When creating HTML code it is very important to keep it clean and easy to read. The person writing the HTML code initially will likely not be the only person to ever read it again. For this reason, it is a good idea to indent nested elements and keep clear comments where needed.</p>

    			What is CSS?
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". CSS is the coding language that determines how the HTML code is displayed and styled.</p>
				<p>In my own mind, I think of CSS as defining a CSS variable in HTML and then assigning that variable a set of CSS style attributes. Where ever that CSS "variable" is used within HTML, the corresponding elements and its contents use the CSS styling associated.</p>
				<p>The following link is a great summary and quick reference from Udacity on CSS. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/m-3611108698">CSS Summary and Reference</a></p>

    			Avoid Repetition in Styling
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>The major benefit of CSS is of not having to duplicate styling multiple times in HTML code. CSS allows for greater efficiency and saves a lot of time for programmers.</p>

				<p>CSS coding can be used three different ways.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML code is linked to a separate CSS file, which is most common, especially for more complicated projects.</li>
						<li>Within a &lt;style&gt; element within the &lt;head&gt; element at top of HTML code. This method could be used for a smaller project.</li>
						<li>Write the styling code within the HTML code. This is least preferred method because it creates a lot of repetition and can lead to mistakes and headaches when debugging.</li>

			<div class="information">
				<p>Programming is a precise sequence of steps to tell the computer or program what to do, and is the core of computer science.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>A programming language is the language used to write computer programs.In natural speaking languages there is too much ambiguity that can often lead to confusion. Programming languages need clear, concise instructions to remove any confusion.</p>
				<p>The building blocks of programming languages are the syntax and semantic rules. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Syntax:</u> The set of rules of the language structure or form.</li>
					<li><u>Semantics:</u> Defines the meaning of the language used.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are many different programming languages, for example Python, which is what we are using in this nanodegree. Below are a few other well known programming languages, but there are many more.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>A function takes input, performs instructions on that input, and produces the desired output. A simple example would be a function called <span class="examples">sum</span>.

    	<h2 id="lesson-3-1">What is Objected Oriented Programming? </h2>
    	<div class="section">

			<div class="information">
				<p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a concept of computer programming that utilizes "objects", which are data structures containing variables and methods.</p>

				<p>OOP is built on classes, and instances of those classes are objects. This structure is more efficient due to less code and is consistent with the natural way of human thinking, thereby easier to follow and understand. Therefore OOP is ideal for larger, complex programming projects.</p>

				<p>OOP and its concept of using classes and objects can be relatable to HTML and CSS. Classes and CSS are similar in that you create them once with the attributes needed, and instances of them, in the form of objects or HTML, can be used in code more efficiently.</p>

				<p>Below is a list of terminology associated with OOP, along with their definitions.</p>

    	<div class="section">

			<div class="information">
				<span class="boldu">Class</span>
				<ul>
					<li>The class is the top of the food chain in OOP. The class is the blueprint of the data structure. The class defines the attributes of the data structure, as well as the methods, or actions associated with the data.</li><br>
					<ul><li><b><u>EX:</u></b> To define a class for Movies the attributes, or instance variables, could be: <i>movie_title, movie_storyline, movie_poster, movie_trailer, length_of_movie</i>, etc. Within the class you can also define a method, which is a function within a class. In the Movie example a Show Trailer method could be established to open the trailer. </li></ul>
				</ul>
				<span class="boldu">Objects/Instance</span>
				<ul>
					<li>In OOP an object refers to a particulate instance of a class. In the class Movie example, an instance of the Movie class could be named Toy_Story. When the instance (object) is created it has to supply the necessary variable data defined in the class.<ul></li>
					<li>In the Movie example, you would enter the particulate <i>movie_title</i> (Toy Story), <i>movie_storyline</i> (A boy and his toys that come to life.), <i>movie_poster</i> (link to movie poster image), <i>movie_trailer</i> (link to movie trailer), <i>length_of_movie</i> (120 minutes), etc.</li></ul>
					<li>The benefit of using the class to define the variable structure is that you can create multiple instances of that class without reproducing the same defined variable code over and over.</li>
				</ul>

				<span class="boldu">Library</span>
				<ul>
					<li>A library is a collection of programming modules used by a program. An example of libraries would be the Python Standard Library for Python language. This library houses all of the standard classes, objects, and functions for the Python language, as well as all documentation related to these.</li>
					<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.html">The Python Standard Library</a></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="boldu">Module</span>
				<ul>
					<li>A module is the file that houses functions from the Python Standard Library, or the file that houses the class and object files. When using a class or object from another file you first have to <i>import</i> the module name at the top of your code.</li>
				</ul>

				<span class="boldu">Constructor</span>
				<ul>
					<li>The constructor is what initializes the new object, or instance, into memory. Within the constructor the instance variables are created to define an object.</li>
					<li>The "def __init__:" function is used as a contructor in Python, and within this function is where instance varaibles are defined.</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="boldu">Self</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Self is always the first parameter defined in the "__init__" function. Self refers to the name of the instance being created.</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="boldu">Instance Variables</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Instance variables are the variables associated with a specific instance, and are defined in the "__init__" function within a class. Instance variables are accessed using the "self" keyword inside of the class, and with the instance name outside of the class.</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="boldu">Instance Methods</span>
				<ul>
					<li>While instance variables define what data is in the class, the instance methods are functions within the class that define any action taken with the data.</li>
					<ul><br>
						<li><span class="boldu">EX:</span> In the Movie class example, we defined <i>"movie_trailer"</i> as one of the variables. If we wanted to show that trailer when selected we could create a <i>"show_trailer"</i> method. You can see an example in the picture below. </li></ul>
				</ul>
				<span class="boldu">Class Variable</span>
				<ul>
					<li>A variable or constant within the class, but outside of the <i>"__init__"</i> function. This variable or object would apply to all instances of the class.</li> <li>The standard is to show all class variables in UPPER CASE.</li><br>
					<ul><li><span class="boldu">EX:</span> In the Movie class example, we may want to create a class constant "VALID_RATINGS = ["G","PG","PG-13","R"]". This constant says that only instances of movies with these ratings could be created.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<span class="boldu">Inheritance</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Inheritance allows new classes/objects to use instance variables from existing classes/objects. The class that is inherited from is called a <i>parent</i> class, while the new class that inherits from the parent class is called a <i>child</i> class. The child class can inherit all or some of the parent class attributes while also adding additional attributes of its own.</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="boldu">Method Overriding</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Method overriding allows a <i>child</i> class to create a method that already exists in one of its <i>parent</i> classes. The <i>child</i> class could utilize the method found in the <i>parent</i> class, but it would only be able to utilize data found within the <i>parent</i> class.When the same method is created within the <i>child</i> class it then overrides the <i>parent</i> class method and can utilize all <i>parent</i> data, as well as data created within the <i>child</i> class.</li>

				</ul>
				<span class="boldu">Abstraction</span>
				<ul>
					<li>By definition, abstraction is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics.</li>
					<li>The way I relate abstraction to what I've learned so far is with the functions within the Python Standard Library. The functions are built and ready for use, but I cannot see all the details of how they were built to make them work. I don't really need to know that information. All I need to know is the function name and what arguments it takes to make it work. Along with this the documentation will help clarify how the function is to be used and what arguments are needed, but as far as the code used to build the function, I do not need to know this information.</li>
